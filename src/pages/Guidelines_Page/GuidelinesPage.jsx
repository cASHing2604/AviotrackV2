    manualInstruction: `(1) Make sure that the static system is free from moisture that is caught in the system, and that there
are no restrictions inthe system.
(2) Make sure that there are no changes in or deformations to the airframe surface that can affect
the relation between the air pressure in the static pressure system and true ambient static air
pressure for any flight configuration.
(3) Close the static pressure alternate source control.
(4) Attach a vacuum source to the static pressure source opening.
(5) Slowly apply the vacuum source until the altimeter indication is a 1,000-foot increase inaltitude.
(6) Cut off the vacuum source to make sure that there is a closed system for one minute.
(7) If the altimeter loss is not more than 100 feet after one minute, the system is good and you can slowly release the vacuum until the system goes back to ambient. If the altimeter loss is more than 100 feet, tighten all connections and do the leak test again. If the rate continues to be more than the maximum allowable, do as follows.
(a) Disconnect the static pressure lines from the airspeed indicator and the vertical speed
indicator. Use suitable fittings to connect the lines together so that the altimeter is the only
instrument connected into the static pressure system.
(b) Do the leakage test again to see if the static pressure system or the instruments that you
bypassed are the cause of the leakage. If the instruments are the cause of the leak, you must have the instruments repaired by an approved repair station, or replaced. If the static pressure system is the problem, do as follows.

CAUTION: Do not apply positive pressure with the airspeed indicator or the vertical speed indicator connected to the static pressure system.

 b.1 Attach a source of positive pressure to the static source opening.
 b.2 Slowly apply positive pressure until the altimeter indication decreases 500-feet, and
stops on this value.
b.3 Put a solution of mild soap and water on the line connections and the static source
flange, and look for bubbles to find leaks.
b.4 Tighten all leaking connections. Repair or replace all damaged parts.
b.5 Connect the airspeed and the vertical speed indicators into the static pressure system and do the static system leak test again.`,
